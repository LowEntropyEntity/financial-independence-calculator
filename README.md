* **annual expenses** - all living expenses
* **annual savings** - this should be the difference between your income and expenses
* **current portfolio value** - all invested assets
* **annual return** - best guess of future returns until financial independence
* **safe withdrawal rate** - percentage of portfolio you expect to safely (without depleting your portfolio) withdraw each year

## Attribution

This calculator is based on [Networthify's calculator](https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement). I made my own version because theirs was taken down and I missed it. Theirs has since come back up. I would recommend my version over theirs because theirs has calculation errors. Namely, increasing income while keeping expenses constant sometimes increases the time to financial independence rather than decreasing it.
